The XFL relaunched today. I wish I could give huge insights to the players and coaches, but honestly I barely know any of them. I do know that I was entertained.

This isn't the old XFL. No gimmicks like custom nameplates. There is some cool innovation though. Being able to hear the coaching radios, in game player interviews, and referee discussions all give great insights.

I'm not sure I'll be able to watch 4 games a week and stay interested. But I could see picking a single team and following them for the whole season.
